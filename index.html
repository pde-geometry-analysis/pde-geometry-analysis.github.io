Serrin-type problems on ring-shaped domains: rigidity results
</summary>
<p>
We provide a characterization of rotationally symmetric solutions to the
Serrin problem on ring-shaped domains in <span
class="math inline">\mathbb{R}^n</span> (<span class="math inline">n \ge
3</span>). Our approach is based on a comparison-geometry argument. By
exploiting a suitable conformal reformulation of the problem, we obtain
sharp gradient estimates, which play a central role in establishing our
main rigidity theorem. The comparison method can be effectively extended
to deal with quasilinear operators. This will be discussed in the second
part of the talk, where we focus on the case of the <span
class="math inline">p</span>-Laplacian torsion problem. This talk is
based on joint works with V. Agostiniani, S. Borghini, L. Mazzieri and
A. Pinamonti.

Stability and Morse Index of a Self-Shrinking Möbius Band in Four
Dimensions
</summary>
<p>
Self-shrinkers are special surfaces that model how shapes collapse under
mean curvature flow, and their Morse index measures how many independent
ways they can be perturbed to decrease the associated area-type
functional. In this talk, I will discuss the stability and Morse index
of a particular self-shrinking Möbius band sitting in four-dimensional
Euclidean space. I will describe how passing to the orientable double
cover of the Möbius band allows us to build a global orthonormal frame
of normal directions and carry out explicit geometric computations,
including the metric, the mean curvature vector, and the stability
operator. A key feature of this example is that the mean curvature never
vanishes, which simplifies the higher-codimension curvature terms that
usually make the analysis much harder. Using the natural rotational
symmetry of the surface and the structure of the double cover, I
decompose normal variations into Fourier modes and reduce the stability
problem to a family of one-dimensional ordinary differential equations
with natural boundary conditions at infinity. I will explain this
reduction, how it leads to a clean decoupling of the problem into
separate modes, and what this reveals about the overall stability and
Morse index of the self-shrinking Möbius band.

Higher order critical Sobolev inequalities on manifolds, optimal
constants and dependence on the geometry
</summary>
<p>
We are interested in the optimal constant problem for the critical
Sobolev embedding of the space <span class="math inline">H^k(M)</span>
into <span class="math inline">L^{2^\sharp}(M)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">k</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">(M,g)</span> is a closed Riemannian manifold of
dimension <span class="math inline">n&gt;2k</span>, and <span
class="math inline">2^\sharp= \frac{2n}{n-2k}</span> is the critical
Sobolev exponent. In this context, we investigate whether the first
optimal constant is attained, with the same value as in the Euclidean
setting. We show that the geometry of the manifold plays a crucial role
in the validity of the optimal inequality, depending on the nature of
the lower-order remainder term that is chosen. The proof strategy works
independently of the order of the problem and relies on the study of the
precise pointwise behavior of an asymptotically singular sequence of
positive solutions to a critical polyharmonic equation with diverging
coefficients. This is joint work with Fr'ed'eric Robert (IECL Nancy).

Stability of the Ball in Isoperimetric Inequalities Between Two
Fractional Perimeters
</summary>
<p>
We prove that the ball is a local minimizer of the scale invariant
isoperimetric ratio between two fractional perimeters under <span
class="math inline">C^1</span> small graph perturbations. To establish
this, we show that the second variation of this functional is coercive
with respect to a suitable Sobolev norm for functions defined over the
unitary sphere in <span class="math inline">\mathbb{R}^n</span>. This
parallels the results known in the literature where one of the two
fractional perimeters is replaced by the volume. This is a joint work
with G. Alberti, J. Mirmina (Università di Pisa) and A. Massaccesi

Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow
</summary>
<p>
When mean curvature flow evolves non-uniquely, the flow is said to
fatten. The work of Ilmanen shows that any weak MCF is supported inside
the fattening, and work of Hershkovits–White identified canonical weak
flows supported on the boundary of the fattening, known as the outermost
flows. It is natural to ask, when the flow fattens, are there weak mean
curvature flows supported strictly inside the fattening? Outside of some
special cases (e.g. flow from cones), this question was entirely open.
We show these interior flows exist, providing a general construction for
non-outermost flows as limits of solutions to the parabolic <span
class="math inline">\varepsilon</span>-Allen—Cahn flow.

A surprising threshold for the method of singular projection
</summary>
<p>
The method of singular projection, introduced by Hardt and Lin (1987)
with roots in the work of Federer and Fleming (1960), is a very useful
tool in geometric analysis, that essentially allows to apply linear
techniques to some problems to which they would normally not because of
a nonlinear constraint. Its range of applications comprises the
approximation problem of mappings into manifolds to the study of
minimizing harmonic maps. In this talk, I will introduce and explain
this method, illustrate its importance by reviewing some of its
applications, and conclude with a recent result featuring a surprising
threshold in the values of the parameters for which this method applies
in the context of fractional Sobolev spaces with less than one
derivative, answering a folklore question raised notably by the harmonic
maps community.

Increase in topological complexity along the mean curvature flow
</summary>
<p>
A hypersurface evolves by mean curvature flow if it moves with velocity
equal to its mean curvature vector at each point. The process is
described by a non-linear parabolic PDE, and solutions form
singularities in finite time. A central question in the is the
classification of these singularities, and the behaviour of the flow as
it moves through them. For surfaces in three-dimensional space, the
picture is well understood: all singularities are modelled by
self-shrinkers of multiplicity one and the genus is non-increasing with
time. However, in higher dimensions, the topology can become more
complex after the first singular time. In this talk we present an
explicit example of such behaviour.

Yamabe metrics on conical manifolds I: existence results via local

We consider the Yamabe equation on conical manifolds with Ricci-flat

solutions may fail to exist in the singular setting. However, in

of a minimizing solution. Based on a joint work with Andrea Malchiodi

Yamabe metrics on conical manifolds II: existence results via min–max

</summary>
<p>
While the Yamabe problem is completely solved on smooth closed
manifolds, its extension to singular spaces presents significant new
challenges. In particular, minimizers of the Yamabe functional may fail
to exist. In this talk, we prove the existence of Yamabe metrics on
four-manifolds with finitely many conical points with <span
class="math inline">Z/2Z</span>-group, using for the first time a
min–max scheme in the singular setting. In our proof, we exploit recent
positive mass theorems in the conical setting and study how the mass of
the conformal blow-up diverges as the blow-up point approaches the
singular set. This is based on joint work with Mattia Freguglia
(Bocconi) and Andrea Malchiodi (SNS).

Cartan’s and Gauss’ equations and rigidity theorems for isometric
embeddings in low Sobolev regularity
</summary>
<p>
Let <span class="math inline">\left\{\eta^i\right\}_{i=1}^2</span> be an
orthonormal coframe on a subdomain <span class="math inline">U</span> of
a smooth surface <span class="math inline">(\Sigma,g)</span>. When <span
class="math inline">\eta^i</span> is smooth, there is a unique
connection <span class="math inline">1</span>-form <span
class="math inline">\omega</span> satisfying Cartan’s structural
equations <span class="math inline">d \eta^1 = \eta^2 \wedge

\omega</span>, and moreover the second structural equation <span
class="math inline">d\omega=K_g dvol_g</span> holds. We show that these
equations remain valid in the sense of distributions when the frame has
only <span class="math inline">C^0 \cap H^{1/2}</span> regularity. From
this, analogous results for the Gauss equation <span
class="math inline">\det D^2=K_g (1+|Df|^2)^2</span> for the graphical
representation of an isometric embeddings <span class="math inline">u
\colon \Sigma \to\mathbb{R}^3</span> can be deduced. The later equation
remains true if <span class="math inline">u \in C^1 \cap

regularity and convexity results in the case of positive Gaussian

Quantitative stability estimates near infinitely concentrated minimisers
</summary>
<p>
I will discuss joint work with Professor Melanie Rupflin, which
establishes quantitative stability estimates for degree one maps of the
Dirichlet Energy from either the torus or hyperbolic surfaces into the
sphere. While the classical question of quantitative stability fails due
to the non-existence of degree one minimisers from the given surface,
the existence of a singular minimiser consisting of a “bubble” and “base
map” can be shown. In this work, we establish a quantitative stability
estimate for this set of singular minimisers through a carefully
constructed combined gradient flow that evolves both domain and map.
